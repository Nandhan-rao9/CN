# 1.6 Networks Under Attack

---

## Via Internet -
**Malware** - can do all kinds of devious things, including deleting our files and installing spyware that collects our private information, such
as social security numbers, passwords, and keystrokes.
* Much of the malware out there today is **self-replicating**

## Denial-of-Service (Dos) attacks :

**Vulnerability attack:** This involves sending a few well-crafted messages to a vulnerable application or operating system running on a targeted host. If the right
sequence of packets is sent to a vulnerable application or operating system, the
service can stop or, worse, the host can crash.

**Bandwidth flooding:** packets sent too many, clogged, legitimate packets not reaching server.

**Connection flooding:** large no of - TCP half,full open conncetions. bogus connections - stops legitimate conncetions.

## Masquerading

**Packet sniffer:** For wireless devices, it creates a security vulnarability - by placing a mob reciever in vicinity of transmitter, it can obtain a copy of the packets being transmitted. 
**layer wise :** packet sniffing targets the lower layers (physical/link) where data is broadcast, while IP tables filter at a higher layer (network).

**IP spoofing:** ability to insert packets into internet with a false source address.
